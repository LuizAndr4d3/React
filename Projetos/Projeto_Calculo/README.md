# Bisection Method Calculator in React.js  

This project is a web application built with **React.js** that allows users to calculate the root of a mathematical function using the **Bisection Method**. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input a mathematical function, specify the number of iterations, and set the initial interval values.  

It uses the **math.js** library for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Features  
- User-friendly input fields for mathematical functions and parameters.  
- Real-time calculation of the Bisection Method steps.  
- Dynamic output displaying the approximation of the root at each iteration.  
- Built entirely in React.js with minimal external dependencies (only math.js).
